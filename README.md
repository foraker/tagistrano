# Tagistrano

Automatically generate version-based git tags on Capistrano deploys.

This gem assumes you are using a X.X.X (major.minor.patch) version tag strategy.
Once set up, you will be prompted to choose a new tag every time a cap task is run.
The options will be generated by incrementing the highest existing version tag.

For example, if your project's current tag is 1.2.3, the prompt will look like this:
```
Tag: (leave blank to skip tagging)
1. Major 2.0.0
2. Minor 1.3.0
3. Patch 1.2.4
```

Allowing you to easily bump your project version, or skip tagging if no new version
is required.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tagistrano'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tagistrano

Finally, add the following line to your Capfile:

```ruby
require 'tagistrano'
```

## Usage

Call the following method wherever you want the tag prompt to show:

```ruby
tag_release
```

This can be called in several places:
- In your deploy.rb file, to prompt on every cap task
- If using multiple stages, in individual stage files, to prompt on every cap task for that stage
- In cap tasks, to only prompt for that specific task
